# Coding

This part of the repository is just a mini course with basic ideas of programming on `C++` and `python`.

These two languages are going to be use as they belong to different kinds of programming languages and therefore, both have different advantages that can be combined in order to improve our codes.

We are going to use `GNUplot` and `Python` to do the plots of the output of the `C++` codes.
